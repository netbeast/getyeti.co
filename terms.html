Except as noted otherwise below, this Agreement is the entire Agreement between us.

          <p>If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Service through your account to these Terms of Service, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity, its affiliates, and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms of Service, you must not accept these Terms of Service and you may not use the Service. You further agree that you assume all responsibility and liability in connection with your use of the Service on behalf of such a company or other legal entity, and you shall be solely responsible for all disputes, if any, that arise due to your use of the Service on behalf of such a company or other legal entity.</p>

          <h1>9. Billing and payment</h1>
          <p><strong>In-app Purchases</strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, Yeti may offer products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Yeti (each, a “Software Store”). If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. <strong>If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Yeti application from your device.</strong> Deleting your account on Yeti or deleting the Yeti application from your device does not cancel your subscription; Yeti will retain all funds charged to your IAP Account until you cancel your subscription through your IAP Account.</p>
          <p><strong>Online purchases</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>Users of the Service may be required to provide their credit card details to Yeti or the payment service provider retained by Yeti (the “PSP”). Users will be responsible for paying agreed-upon fees for the Service. Users of the Service will be liable for any taxes required to be paid on the Service provided under the Agreement (other than taxes on the Company’s income).</p>
          <p>All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not required to provide payment account information. An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.</p>
          <p>For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable, except after the first 14 days after the first charge for the service. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. </p>
          <p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.</p>
          <p><strong>Trials</strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). Yeti reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.</p>
          <p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. AT THE END OF SUCH TRIALS, WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING MONTHLY, QUARTERLY OR ANUAL BASIS. BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR IN-APP PAYMENT PROVIDER SETTINGS OR CONTACTING SUPPORT. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR IN-APP PAYMENT PROVIDER SETTINGS OR CONTACTING SUPPORT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING MONTHLY PERIOD. PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, YETI WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.</p>
          <p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
          <p>Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.</p>
          <p>To request a refund: <br>If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not Yeti. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit “Report Problem”. You can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.</p>
          <p>If you subscribed using your Google Play Store account or through an online purchase: please contact customer support (hello@getyeti.co) with your order number for the Google Play Store (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to Google Wallet) or through an online purchase (you can find this on your confirmation email). You may also mail or deliver a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this agreement, or words of similar effect. Please also include the email address or telephone number associated with your account along with your order number. This notice shall be sent to: Netbeast, SL. Attn: Cancellations, Calle Albareda 14, Local Grow Working, 41001 Sevilla, Spain.</p>

          <h1>15. Dispute resolution</h1>
          <p>INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Yeti agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Yeti. Yeti’s address for such notices is Netbeast, S.L., Avenida Santa Lucía 55-14, 41500 Alcalá de Guadaira, Sevilla, Spain.</p>
          <p>BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and Yeti are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the 5/2012 Law, of July the 6th,  on mediation of civil and mercantile matters, as published in the official state bulletin “BOE” of July the 7th 2012 (Reference BOE-A-2012-9112) and approved by the head of state of Spain, available at the website https://www.boe.es/. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by official law. If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Yeti will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Yeti may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
          <p>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a state court located within the Sevilla with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>
          <p>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Yeti agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Yeti and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND YETI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Yeti otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p>
          <p>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in Sevilla, Spain. You and Yeti agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the Spanish state and courts located in Sevilla, Spain have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Yeti agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

          <h2>e. Attorneys’ and accountants’ fees, remedies</h2>
          <p>In any action to enforce the Terms of Service, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and costs.</p>
          <p>You agree that Yeti&#x27;s remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Yeti shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Yeti may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys&#x27; fees.</p>
          <p>No right or remedy of Yeti shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys&#x27; fees, and expenses.</p>
          <p>No instance of waiver by Yeti of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.</p>
