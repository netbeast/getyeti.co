          <h1>2. How do we collect, use, and share your Personal Information and other information?</h1>
          <h2>a. Information you provide to us</h2>
          <p>When you register for the Service, we may ask for Personal Information such as your name, email address, or credit card or other billing information. Additionally, as users employ the Services to control smart home peripherals, the software continuously saves changes made by users with the server and will document items such as when users are creating automation rules and saving changes, when a user last opened the app, when changes to a smart home peripheral’s state are made, or when a user performs certain tasks.</p>
          <p>We may also retain the contents of any messages you send to us or through the Service, and we may collect information you provide in user content that you post or upload to the Service (“User Content”).</p>
          <p>Yeti may use Personal Information provided to operate, improve upon, and personalize the Service, for billing identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, to support use of the Service, to send marketing materials (subject to your opt-in option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service. We may also combine your Personal Information with third-party analytics information to build a broader profile of our individual users so that we can serve you better and provide custom, personalized content and information. Additionally, we may use the Personal Information we collect for identification and authentication and fraud prevention, to analyze Site and Service usage and improve the Service, for internal market research, troubleshooting problems, to enforce our Terms of Service, and as otherwise set forth in this Policy. Note that we will never email you to ask for your account information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to hello@netbeast.co.</p>
          <p>If you would like more information about our policy, please review our <a href="https://getyeti.co/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
          <p>We use financial information solely as authorized by you in accordance with the Service. While Yeti does not store your credit card information and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other Personal Information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal and/or financial information stored therein, and you agree to hold Yeti harmless for any damages that may result therefrom.</p>
          <h2>b. Information we may receive from and share with third parties</h2>
          <p>We may now or in the future receive Personal Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our Site or Service through a third-party connection or log-in or connect an application to Yeti, that third party you connected with may pass certain information about your use of its service to Yeti. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that third-party service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.</p>
          <p>Yeti may also share Personal Information with its third party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other service we use to operate the Service and maintain a high-quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the Personal Information we share for their marketing purposes.</p>
          <h2>c. Analytics information</h2>
          <p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser and our mobile service as part of a web page request, including information that assists us in improving the Service. We may collect and use this analytics information together with your Personal Information to build a broader profile of our individual users so that we can serve you better.</p>
          <p>The Site primarily uses the following analytical tools, for which we include relevant privacy information and opt-out options:</p>
          <p><strong>Google Analytics and Google Adwords</strong></p>
          <p>Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is restricted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161129190620/http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161129190620/http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>.

You may prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161129190620/https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

          <p>Hotjar’s use of information collected through Hotjar is set forth in its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161129190620/https://www.hotjar.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which includes instructions for opt-out.</p>

          <h2>d. Log files</h2>
          <p>Yeti gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, search terms, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</p>
          <h2>e. Cookies</h2>
          <p>A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer’s hard drive. The main purpose of cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user’s computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to user’s preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities on the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Sites and users of the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies don’t give us access to users’ computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn’t include Personal Information.</p>
          <p>We utilize session cookies, which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to make it easier to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.</p>
          <p>Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you require more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by email at hello@netbeast.co.</p>
          <h2>f. Clear GIFs/web beacons information</h2>
          <p>When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
          <h2>g. Device identifiers</h2>
          <p>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a unique device identifier (“UDID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Yeti. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
          <h2>h. Application integration</h2>
          <p>In order to facilitate the exchange of data between third-party SaaS applications, we may need to store certain information (“App Credentials”) that helps us access these third-party SaaS application accounts on your behalf. We store your App Credentials in an encrypted form.</p>
          <p>When we access these third-party applications on your behalf, the third-party application provides us with access to certain data. We will use, store, and disclose this data in accordance with this Policy.</p>
          <p>You should note that Yeti shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third-party applications for which you provide us with App Credentials.</p>
          <h2>i. Other information sharing</h2>
          <p>In addition to the purposes described above, we disclose Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders and law enforcement or governmental requests or investigations, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
          <p>We use or may use information such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, and clear GIFs information to:</p>
          <p>(a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site</p>
          <p>(b) provide custom, personalized content and information</p>

We use commercially reasonable technological, physical, and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully developed security features, to protect the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information within the Service and the Sites. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures, and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, email, or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.
